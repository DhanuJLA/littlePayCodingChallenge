# Little Pay Coding Challenge

## Assumptions

For the purposes of this exercise I have assumed that bus journeys will not start on one day and finish the next.
Only taps made on the same day are processed to create trips. 

The CSV file will have taps from multiple days and they may not be listed in chronological order in the file. 

A person (identified by PAN) could have multiple trips on a given day.

They could have a combination of completed, incomplete or cancelled trips. 

Every tap off has a related tap on.

In the event a person 'taps off' as they are leaving a bus
without having tapped on, because the system has not had a tap on recorded this 'tap off' is assumed to have been recorded as a tap on.
